Assignment 1: Sensation, Challenge, Drama

My game is called "Michael Caine Racing".

Experience
----------
My overarching design goal was to create a casual game with simple mechanics and simple controls which produced enough of a challenge and enough drama to help the player achieve flow.

Sensation
---------
I was aiming for a somewhat light hearted game feel, so that the player could be relaxed and enjoy the game rather than stressing and being competitive. I tried to achieve this by keeping the rules of the game simple, as well as the controls. Limiting the controls to the directional buttons would have ensured a gentle learning curve.

Unfortunately I am not an artist, so the artwork was quite simplistic. I was generally aiming for a familiar cartoony appearance, with some expressionistic overtones to match the dramatic arc of the game. For example, when the player is losing and their car is damaged, everything pulses red. This is to amplify the feelings of irritation and panic that the player may feel when they are about to die.

The sounds were also designed to match the drama. Michael Caine is supposed to say things matching the situation at hand, so he will say "hahaha" and "excellent" when you run over the muppets, but then he will say "no" and "bah, humbug" when he hits lamp posts etc. The people also make noises, and "splat" sounds when they are run over, adding to the building excitement in later levels where there are many people on the screen to run over. The music track is really just fodder, it is just there to make the game seem polished to the player.

Challenge
---------
With this game I was actually trying to avoid challenge somewhat, so as to avoid making it require too much thought. This game mainly presented physical challenges (and some emotional challenges) rather than intellectual challenges. The physical challenges were:

I couldnt think of simple ways of making the game socially challenging, given that it was a single-player game where the core mechanics were moving around and colliding with objects.
What kinds of challenge were you aiming for? Is it physical, intellectual, emotional, social? What specific skills are you aiming to test?

Drama
-----
What dramatic arc are you trying to achieve in your game? What kind of pacing? Is it slow? fast? tense? relaxing?

Mechanics
---------
"Michael Caine Racing" implements the core mechanics for this assignment as such:
* The player controls a car using the directional keys. Up accelerates, down brakes/reverses, left turns left and right turns right. The car follows iconic oversimplified Newtonian mechanics, in that it can accelerate, it rebounds off lamp posts, and it slows down over time when it is coasting. The choice of the directional keys was an obvious one for us, because it is simple, portable (accessible across different languages, keyboard layouts, etc), and somewhat intuitive. We could have perhaps gone with another control scheme for example a left and right key next to each other, then separately had accelerate and brake/reverse as two other keys. This arguably is conceptually closer to the controls of a real world vehicle, however we decided against this in the name of simplicity and portability. This control scheme allows the player to play with one hand, perhaps allowing them to be more relaxed.
* The object of the game is to run over pedestrians i.e. "good" things, which run away from you and try to avoid being run over. It was hoped that the drama of having the pedestrians run away from their impending doom would engage the player and encourage them to follow through with their duties with the sense of satisfaction that comes with an inevitable victory.
* There are objects to avoid (i.e. "bad" objects) such as lampposts which damage your car. These are generally inanimate. The idea behind this was that the player would be their own worst enemy, and this would hopefully add to the irony of the game and add an extra dimension to the drama. We could have had intelligent adversaries which chased you down, but this seemed unnatural, c.f. the "police" in Driver that ram into your car until it is destroyed rather than pulling you over, as the background story would suggest.
* The overall objective is to run over all the people within a time limit without totalling your car. Failing to complete this results in "Game Over", with the option to restart. Each time the player succeeds, they are challenged with a progressively harder level. This progression of levels was intended to help the player achieve flow, in that as they become more confident at the game it becomes progressively harder, so that ideally the relative level of difficulty consistently facilitates flow.

Dynamics
--------
This game has several dynamics:
* Driving - the player controls a car which somewhat simulates an RL car that one would drive. This presents the player with some of the challenges of driving, i.e. steering, speed and so on.
* Dodging - the player controls the car in such a manner so as to avoid colliding with the obstacles (with which colliding would cause eventual death). This adds more challenge and drama, as the player has to speed around whilst avoiding these obstacles. This presents somewhat of an economic drama, e.g. is it worth driving at full speed into a wall to squash the pedestrian.
* Chasing - the player has to chase the pedestrians, who are trying to avoid death. This unwillingness of the pedestrians to be run over creates a sense of drama in that the player has to kill them against their will.
* Herding - it is usually easier to herd the people together (which to some extent they naturally do when left unthreatened) so that they can be defeated in batch, swiftly. This adds a tactical/strategic element to the game, where the player will attempt to collect the people together so that they can speed over them all in one go.
