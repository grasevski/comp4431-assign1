Experience
----------
My overarching design goal was to create a casual game with simple mechanics and simple controls which produced enough of a challenge and enough drama to help the player achieve flow.

Sensation
---------
I was aiming for a somewhat light hearted game feel, so that the player could be relaxed and enjoy the game rather than stressing and being competitive. I tried to achieve this by keeping the rules of the game simple, as well as the controls. Limiting the controls to the directional buttons would have ensured a gentle learning curve.

Unfortunately I am not an artist, so the artwork was quite simplistic. I was generally aiming for a familiar cartoony appearance, with some expressionistic overtones to match the dramatic arc of the game. For example, when the player is losing and their car is damaged, everything pulses red. This is to amplify the feelings of irritation and panic that the player may feel when they are about to die.

The sounds were also designed to match the drama. Michael Caine is supposed to say things matching the situation at hand, so he will say "hahaha" and "excellent" when you run over the muppets, but then he will say "no" and "bah, humbug" when he hits lamp posts etc. The people also make noises, and "splat" sounds when they are run over, adding to the building excitement in later levels where there are many people on the screen to run over. The music track is really just fodder, it is just there to make the game seem polished to the player.

Challenge
---------
With this game I was actually trying to avoid challenge somewhat, so as to avoid making it require too much thought. This game mainly presented physical challenges (and some emotional challenges) rather than intellectual challenges. The physical challenges were:

I couldnt think of simple ways of making the game socially challenging, given that it was a single-player game where the core mechanics were moving around and colliding with objects.
What kinds of challenge were you aiming for? Is it physical, intellectual, emotional, social? What specific skills are you aiming to test?

Drama
-----
What dramatic arc are you trying to achieve in your game? What kind of pacing? Is it slow? fast? tense? relaxing?

Mechanics
---------
Describe the mechanics of your game in detail. Justify your mechanics in terms of how they achieve your stated design goals.

Dynamics
--------
Discuss the dynamics that come out of game play. How are they grounded in the mechanics? What effect do they have on the player?

Improvements
------------
Reflect on the ways your game could be improved.
