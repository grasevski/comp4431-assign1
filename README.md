Experience
----------
My overarching design goal was to create a casual game with simple mechanics and simple controls which produced enough of a challenge and enough drama to help the player achieve flow.

Sensation
---------
The sensory approach that our game aims to offer is that of a colourful, entertaining aesthetic. Through the game mechanics, our sensory appeal will be through playful, cathartic mechanics of semi-violence, combined with a mechanics system reminiscent of the classic Grand Theft Auto games. Our games mechanics involve a medieval chariot that turns like a car and can accelerate forwards or reverse. This scheme will be familiar to many players, and thus will imply the intended goals for success.

The visual aesthetics of our game are colourful and stylised amidst a fantastical setting. Through this stylised and cartoony aesthetic, our intent is to create a sensory experience that is decidedly light-hearted and enjoyable. Since the core mechanics consist of violent acts, the art style will serve as a counterpoint to this and not discourage player actions.

The visual effects will be similarly exaggerated to serve as subversion to the actions of the player and maintain the entertaining and light-hearted aesthetic, to encourage player enjoyment. When the player runs over a goblin, for example, instead of the expected blood, the effect will simply be of a knocked-over goblin.

The audio effects are also intended to maintain this sensory appeal. Since the core mechanic involves violently running over goblins, rather than use realistic sounds, which would cause dissonance with our intended aesthetic, the audio effects are intended to be entertaining, rather than disturbing. Thuds and entertaining goblin noises are intended to maintain this aesthetic. And finally, the ambient music is entertaining rock/metal music, that serves to reinforce player enjoyment and power within the game.


Challenge
---------
The kind of challenge we are aiming to cater for is primarily physical and mental.

The main challenge that will be presented in our game is that of coordination and reflexes. The control of the player and his objectives to run down enemies encourage fast movement, but obstacles that pose a hazard to the players health are randomly placed across the map. The main challenge to the player is having the reflexes and being coordinated enough to avoid these obstacles while travelling at speed.

Additionally, extra challenge will be presented to the player through the addition of a timer. This will exacerbate player difficulties with controlling their avatar due to the mental pressure it will put them under.  Not only does it add the challenge of completing the level within a time limit, it also makes the coordination and reflexes previously mentioned much harder, since it will force fast movement and, likely, rash player decisions.


Drama
-----
The dramatic arc we are trying to achieve for this game is a fast paced and enjoyable one. Fast player movement and quick maneuvers engender a fast-paced game, and the drama of the game for the first few levels should be one of laid-back enjoyment at the power of the player and the powerlessness of the enemies. As the player continues in level, however, we expect this arc to shift towards even faster-paced action and tension as the levels become more difficult to complete.


Mechanics
---------
"Medieval Chariot Racing" implements the core mechanics for this assignment as such:
* The player controls a chariot using the directional keys. Up accelerates, down brakes/reverses, left turns left and right turns right. The chariot follows iconic oversimplified Newtonian mechanics, in that it can accelerate, it rebounds off obstacles, and it slows down over time when it is coasting. The choice of the directional keys was for simplicity and portability (accessible across different languages, keyboard layouts, etc). After some playtesting with my parents, these controls seemed somewhat counterintuitive. The playtesters spent more time reversing than accelerating, for instance. It was also confusing for players to be moving downward on the screen whilst pressing the "up" key. For this reason, the comma and period keys were added as alternative controls for braking/reversing and accelerating, respectively. This arguably is conceptually closer to the controls of a real world vehicle.
* The object of the game is to run over goblins i.e. "good" things, which run away from you and try to avoid being run over. It was hoped that the drama of having the goblins run away from their impending doom would engage the player and encourage them to follow through with their duties with the sense of satisfaction that comes with an inevitable victory.
* There are objects to avoid (i.e. "bad" objects) such as rocks and shrubs which damage your chariot. These are inanimate. The idea behind this was that the player would be their own worst enemy, and this would hopefully add to the irony of the game and add an extra dimension to the drama. We could have had intelligent adversaries which chased you down, but this seemed unnatural, c.f. the "police" in Driver that ram into your car until it is destroyed rather than pulling you over, as the background story would suggest.
* The overall objective is to run over all the people within a time limit without totalling your car. Failing to complete this results in "Game Over", with the option to restart. Each time the player succeeds, they are challenged with a progressively harder level. This progression of levels was intended to help the player achieve flow, in that as they become more confident at the game it becomes progressively harder, so that ideally the relative level of difficulty consistently facilitates flow.

Dynamics
--------
This game has several dynamics:
* Driving - the player controls a chariot which somewhat simulates an RL car that one would drive. This presents the player with some of the challenges of driving, i.e. steering, speed and so on.
* Dodging - the player controls the car in such a manner so as to avoid colliding with the obstacles (with which colliding would cause eventual death). This adds more challenge and drama, as the player has to speed around whilst avoiding these obstacles. This presents somewhat of an economic drama, e.g. is it worth driving at full speed into a wall to squash the goblin.
* Chasing - the player has to chase the goblins, who are trying to avoid death. This unwillingness of the goblins to be run over creates a sense of drama in that the player has to kill them against their will.
* Herding - it is usually easier to herd the people together (which to some extent they naturally do when left unthreatened) so that they can be defeated in batch, swiftly. This adds a tactical/strategic element to the game, where the player will attempt to collect the people together so that they can speed over them all in one go.
